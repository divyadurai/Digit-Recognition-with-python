Digit Recognition:

Python code is used to recognize the digit based on 784pixels(input unit) using neural network

Step 1: Splitted the train data into train data and test data in 80:20 ratio

Step 2: Scaling the data to get improved efficiency

Step 3: Implementing a neural network for the datasets (multi layer perceptron) and develop a model

Step 4: Predicting the output using confusion matrix

Step 5: Implementing the model on test dataset
